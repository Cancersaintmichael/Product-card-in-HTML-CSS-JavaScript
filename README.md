# Product-card-in-HTML-CSS-JavaScript

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/web-platform-m752ge)

Mainly inspired by Frontend Mentor's "Product Card" challange. I modified it, chose a different product instead, and decided to imitate the style of Chanel's minimalistic product page. Interactive features coming soon.
